# Project Title

Short and clear description of the project in one sentence.

---

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering solution designed to ingest,
process, and store data in a scalable and maintainable way.

The goal is to simulate a real-world production data pipeline, focusing on reliability,
readability, and cloud-oriented design principles.

---

## 🏗 Architecture
The pipeline follows a layered architecture approach, commonly used in production
data platforms.
